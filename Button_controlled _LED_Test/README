The goal of this project is to control the onboard LED of an STM32 Nucleo board using a push button.  
When the button is pressed, the LED turns ON; when released, the LED turns OFF.  
This project demonstrates GPIO input and output configuration in STM32CubeIDE.
Hardware Requirements
- STM32 Nucleo development board (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE)
- Micro-USB cable
Software Requirements
- STM32CubeIDE (includes STM32CubeMX)
- ST-LINK driver (for programming the Nucleo board)

  Learning Outcomes
- Configure GPIO pins for input and output in STM32CubeIDE.
- Understand the basics of reading digital inputs.
- Control outputs based on user interaction.
- Learn about button debouncing.
