**STM32 Nucleo – I²C LCD Module with Timer**
**Goal**
Interface a 16×2 HD44780-compatible LCD with an STM32 Nucleo board using the I²C protocol.Demonstrate I²C communication and timer-based periodic updates, such as refreshing text every fixed interval

**Hardware Requirements**

- STM32 Nucleo development board (e.g., NUCLEO-F446RE)

- 16×2 LCD module with I²C backpack (PCF8574 or similar)

- Micro-USB cable (for power + programming)

- Jumper wires

**Connections:**

- LCD VCC → Nucleo 5V (or 3.3V if backpack supports it)

- LCD GND → GND

- LCD SDA → PB9

- LCD SCL → PB8

**Software Requirements**

- STM32CubeIDE (includes STM32CubeMX and HAL drivers)

- ST-LINK driver (bundled with Nucleo boards)

**Code Flow**

- Initialize system clock and peripherals.

- Configure I²C1 in STM32CubeMX:

- Mode: I²C

- SDA: PB9

- SCL: PB8

- Speed: 100 kHz / 400 kHz

- Configure TIM2 (general-purpose timer):

- Prescaler/Period to achieve 1 kHz tick or 500 ms interrupt

- Write ISR callback:

- In HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback, set a flag or increment a counter.

- In the main loop, act on this flag to update the LCD.

- Display text/numbers on the LCD using I²C commands.

**Necessary Reading / Considerations**

Basics of I²C protocol: addressing, data vs. command modes.

HD44780 command set for LCD control.

Timer calculations for STM32 (prescaler + period).

ISR design principle: keep ISRs short, defer work to while(1).

 **Learning Outcomes**

Configure and use I²C on STM32 with the HAL library.

Understand LCD command flow (PCF8574 → HD44780).

Implement timer-driven, non-blocking periodic tasks.

Apply clean HAL-based peripheral initialization.

Strengthen debugging skills for embedded I²C communication.

**Challenges**

Timer Calculations: Computing correct prescaler/period values for precise timing.

Interrupt Handling: Keeping ISRs lightweight and deferring LCD updates to main loop.

Glitches with Delays: Improper delay handling can cause partial or corrupted LCD output.
