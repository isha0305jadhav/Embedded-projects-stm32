  LED Blink on STM32 Nucleo
1. Goal The aim of this project was to make the onboard LED of the STM32 Nucleo board blink at a fixed interval. 
2. Required Tools
Hardware:
STM32 Nucleo development board (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE)
Micro-USB cable
Software:
STM32CubeIDE (includes STM32CubeMX for pin and peripheral configuration)
Learning Outcomes
Understood how to use STM32CubeIDE to configure microcontroller peripherals.
Learned the basics of GPIO pin control.
Got hands-on practice with the build–flash–test cycle for embedded systems.
Understood how HAL functions work for hardware abstraction.
